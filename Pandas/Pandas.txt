Pandas DataFrame

# Dataframe is an object that stores data as rows and columns.

# You can think of it as a spreadsheet or an SQL table.

# You can manually create a Dataframe or fill it with data from a CSV, an Excel spreadsheet, or SQL.

# Rows and columns are present in DataFrames. Each column is identified by a string name. Each row has a 
unique integer index. Strings, ints, floats, tuples, and other data types can be stored in DataFrames.
